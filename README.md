# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
Created a basic HTML web page.


Using the ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.


Add an input tag to the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Level 2: Multiple Search Categories



Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time

city

state

country

shape

Level 3: Paginated Table



Wrote code that will paginate the table (client-side pagination) and only display a maximum set number of results at a time (e.g. 50 results per page). Used Bootstrap's Pagination Components and write code to handle page changes and calculate the number of results which should appear on each page.

These changes should happen in the DOM using JavaScript, therefore the user should never be directed to another web page as they paginate through the results.
